# Bluff Grid - Fixes Summary

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ TASK 1: Fix Grid Creation Error
**Problem:** Users couldn't create grids due to schema mismatch
**Solution:**
- Fixed User model schema in `backend/Models/User.js`
  - Changed from `trueStatement` (String) to `trueStatementIndex` (Number)
  - Updated validation to accept exactly 5 statements (not 9)
- Added better error logging in `/api/save-grid` endpoint
- Now properly saves grid with title, 5 statements, and true statement index

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/Models/User.js`
- `backend/server.js` (save-grid endpoint)

---

### ✅ TASK 2: Get True Statement Information from MongoDB
**Status:** Already working correctly
**Details:**
- The `trueStatementIndex` is now properly stored in MongoDB
- Backend retrieves it when loading grids for gameplay
- Frontend receives it in the roomData.questions[0].trueStatementIndex field

---

### ✅ TASK 3: Fix "Next Player Grid" Button
**Problem:** Button didn't work to advance to next player's grid
**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error logging to the `next-player-grid` socket handler
- Improved error messages for debugging:
  - Room not found
  - Player not found
  - Missing firebaseId
  - No grids created by player
  - Grid not found in database
- Better handling when player has no grids (shows helpful error message)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server.js` (next-player-grid handler)

**How It Works:**
1. Host clicks "Next Player's Grid" button
2. Backend finds the next player in `roundOrder`
3. Looks up that player's firebaseId
4. Fetches their grid from MongoDB
5. Starts new round with that grid
6. All players see the new grid's statements

---

### ✅ TASK 4: Round Count Matches Player Count
**Status:** Already implemented correctly
**Details:**
- Rounds are set to `room.roundOrder.length` which equals number of players
- Each player gets exactly 1 round with their grid
- Game ends when `roundIndex >= roundOrder.length`

---

### ✅ TASK 5: Track Correct/Incorrect Answers Per Round
**Problem:** Needed to track and display who answered correctly
**Solution:**
- Backend now calculates scores immediately when answers are submitted
- Logs whether each answer was correct or incorrect
- Stores in `player.scores[questionIndex]`
- Prevents duplicate answer submissions

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server.js` (submit-answer handler)

---

### ✅ TASK 6: Leaderboard with Winner Display
**Status:** Already implemented correctly
**Details:**
- Leaderboard sorts players by totalScore (descending)
- Shows top 3 players with special cards
- Winner gets "Winner!" badge
- Shows remaining players below

**File:** `frontend/src/Pages/Leaderboard/Leaderboard.jsx`

---

### ✅ TASK 7: Real-time Vote Counts Display
**Problem:** Needed to show how many people voted for each answer
**Solution:**
- Backend now calculates vote counts in real-time
- Emits `voteCounts` array with round-complete event
- Emits partial counts with `answer-submitted` event (as people answer)
- Frontend displays vote counts below each answer after reveal

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/server.js` (submit-answer handler)
- `frontend/src/Pages/game/game.jsx` (added voteCounts state and listeners)

**How It Works:**
1. Player submits answer
2. Backend calculates how many voted for each option
3. Sends updated counts to all players
4. After round ends, shows final vote counts
5. Display format: "X vote(s)" below each answer

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### If "Next Player Grid" Doesn't Work:
Check console logs for:
- "This player has not created any grids yet" → That player needs to create a grid first
- "Grid owner not found in database" → Player's firebaseId not matching database
- "Next player not found" → Room state corrupted

### If Grid Creation Fails:
- Check browser console for error message
- Check backend logs for detailed error
- Verify MongoDB connection is active
- Ensure statements array has exactly 5 items
- Ensure truthIndex is set (0-4)
